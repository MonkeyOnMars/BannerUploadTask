Need to look into shceduling java functionality. 
Meanwhile threads are used. 

WINDOWS:

Build code with "build_win.bat". 
JAVA_HOME must be set. 

Added ANT into project directory for builds. external/apache-ant-1.9.6  

When code is built, run jar via  calling "run_win.bat"


UNX:

Build code with buildx.sh. JAVA_HOME must be set. 
Rub code with runx.sh.
